Hello! My Name is Erwin Diallo and I'm the creator of this program!

I have designed a desktop cleaner code that is accessible through the file called "DesktopCleaner.py".

This code was only tested through a WINDOWS device (might not work on macOS).
The purpose of this program is to clean up your computer desktop and give you feedback on the files moved and the type of files that were displaced through the means of the algorithm.
Unless you're using a virtual environment, I would suggest abstaining from using the algorithm (unless you would like to test the algorithm on your personal desktop)
