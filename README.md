Hello! My Name is Erwin Diallo and I'm the creator of this program!

I have designed a desktop cleaner code which is accessible through the file called "DesktopCleaner".

The purpose of this program is to clean up your computer desktop and give you feedback on the files moved and the type of files that were displaced through the means of the algorithm.
Unless you're using a virtual environment, I would suggest abstaining from using the algorithm (unless you would like to test the algorithm on your desktop)
